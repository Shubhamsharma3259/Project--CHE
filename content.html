    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The rapid population growth and economic development in country are degrading the environment through the uncontrolled growth of urbanization and industrialization, expansion and intensification of agriculture, and the destruction of natural habitats. One of the major causes of environmental degradation in India could be attributed to rapid growth of population, which is adversely affecting the natural resources and environment. The growing population and the environmental deterioration face the challenge of sustained development without environmental damage. The existence or the absence of favorable natural resources can facilitate or retard the process of economic development. The three fundamental demographic factors of births, deaths and migration produce changes in population size; composition, distribution and these changes raise a number of important questions of cause and effect. Population Reference Bureau estimated the 6.14 billion world's population in mid 2001. Contribution of India alone to this population was estimated to be 1033 millions. It is estimated that the countryâ€™s population will increase to 1.26 billion by the year 2016. The projected population indicates that India will be a first most populous country in the world and China will be second in 2050 (Population Reference Bureau, 2001). The increase of population has been tending towards alarming situation. India is having 18 percent of the world's population on 2.4 percent of its land area has great deal of pressure on its all natural resources. Water shortages, soil exhaustion, deforestation, air and water pollution afflicts many areas. If the world population continues to multiply, the impact on environment could be devastating. </p>

    <h1>Population growth in India</h1>
    <p>India is the second most populous country in the world after China. Recently, the population of India has crossed the one billion marks. According to the Census of India 2001, the population of India on 1st March 2001 was 1027 millions. At the time of independence, the country's population was 342 million. The number has multiplied three-fold in around five decades. The population growth of India from 1951 to 2001 is presented in Table 1. The total population size of India had grown from 361 million in 1951 to around 1027 million in 2001. The population of India increased by three times during the period of 1951-2001. The rural population of India has increased around two and half times from 298.7 million to 741.7 million during 1951-2001, whereas the urban population has grown 4.6 fold from 62.4 million in 1951 to 285.3 million in 2001. The decadal growth rates of the population are irregular, as it increased from 13.31 percent in 1951 to 24.8 percent in 1971. It declined to 24.7 percent in 1981, 23.8 percent in 1991 and 21.35 percent in 2001. The rural decadal growth rate of population varies from 8.79 percent in 1951 to 17.97 percent in 2001, whereas the urban decadal growth rate of population varies from 41.43 percent in 1951 to 31.11 percent in 2001.</p>
    <p> There are various reasons for this variation in the trend of population growth rate in various censuses. The increase in population has been due to the improvement in health conditions and control of diseases. The density of population has gone up from 117 in 1951 to 312 persons in 2001 and it always shows an increasing trend over the census years in persons per square kilometer. Several push and pull factors are presumed to be operative towards distress out migration from rural to urban areas. This might be due to the declining resource availability per capita and shrinking economic opportunities in rural areas, and better economic opportunities, health and educational facilities etc. in urban areas, providing opportunities for higher level of human capital development could be the underlying factors for rural out migration.</p>

                    <td >India faces the most acute pressure on agricultural land. Today every million hectares of land supports 7.27 million people. Forty three percent of the land is under cultivation, one of the highest in the world. A change in land utilization pattern implies an increase or decrease in the proportion of area under different land uses at a point in two or more time periods. Table 4 describes the land utilization pattern in India from 1951 to 2001. Over the past fifty years, while India's total population increased by about 3 times, the total area of land under cultivation increased by only 20.27 percent from 118.75 million hectares in 1951 to 142.82 million hectares in 2001. Most of this expansion has taken place at the expense of forest and grazing land. Despite past expansion of the area under cultivation, less agricultural land is available to feed each person in India. It shows variations in land use and a narrow range of fluctuations in the proportion of net sown area to total land in the country since 1951 to 2001. Out of total geographical area of 329 million hectares, only 306 million hectares is the reporting area (the rest being unadministered for various reasons). The land for non-agricultural uses (housing, industry and others) is increased from 9.36 million hectares in 1951 to 22.97 million hectares in 2001. More than 19.4 million hectares are snow bound and remote leaving only 237 million-hectare for agriculture, forestry, pasture and other biomass production. The area under cultivation had increased by about 30 percent until 1981 and thereafter depicts marginal decline. The net sown area increased from 119 million hectares in 1950-51 to 140 million hectares in 1970-71 mostly through reclamation of old fallow and culturable wastelands and 7 diversion of groves. The net area sown has increased only marginally from 140 million hectares in 1970-71 to 141 million hectares in 2000-2001, indicating that the private efforts have peaked and the intervention of the Government is required for further land reclamation.</td>
                    <td >Direct impacts of agricultural development on the environment arise from farming activities, which contribute to soil erosion, land salination and loss of nutrients. The spread of green revolution has been accompanied by over exploitation of land and water resources and use of fertilizers and pesticides have increased many folds. Shifting cultivation has also been an important cause of land degradation. Leaching from extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers is an important source of contamination of water bodies. Intensive agriculture and irrigation contribute to land degradation particularly salination, alkalization and water logging. It is evident that most of the land in the country is degrading, thus affecting the productive resource base of the economy. Out of the total geographical area of 328.7 million hectares, 175 million hectares are considered to be land-degraded area (Table 5). Water and wind erosion is the major contributor of 141.3 million hectares to soil erosion, with other factors like water logging 8.5 million hectares, alkali soil 3.6 million hectares, acid soil 4.5 million hectares, saline soil including coastal sandy areas 5.5 million hectares adding to the situ degradation. While soil erosion by rain and river in hill areas causes landslides and floods, deforestation, overgrazing, traditional agricultural practices, mining and incorrect siting of development projects in forest areas have resulted in opening up of these areas to heavy soil erosion. Ravines and gullies 8 reported 4 million hectares; area subject to shifting cultivation reported 4.9 million hectares and riverine and torrents erosion due to floods and eutrophication due to agricultural run off reported 2.7 million hectares. The increasing intensification and extensification also results in salination, alkalization and water logging in irrigated areas of the country. For achieving and maintaining food security, sustainable forestry, agricultural and rural developments controlling of land/soil erosion is very much necessary. </td>

                    <td >With less than 2 percent of the world's total forest area, the country supports 18 percent of its population. The total area under forests was 675.54 thousand square kilometers in 2001, which was 21 percent of the total geographical area, as against the National Forest Policy 1988 stipulation of a target of 33 percent. Even within this recorded area, only 416.81 thousand square kilometers, or only 12.68 percent of country's total land area, comprises dense forest with a crown density of more than 40 percent, thus reflecting a qualitative decline of forests in the country. The comparative situation of forest cover in India is given in Table 6. Overall, the total forest cover had been increased by 35.43 thousand square kilometers (Sq. Kms.) from 640.11 thousand Sq. Kms. in 1993 to 675.54 thousand Sq. Kms. in 2001. In the year 2001, as compared to 1999, the total forest cover had increased by 38.24 thousand Sq. Kms. The states which shown significant increase in forest covers are Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal and Rajasthan. However, it has increased in 1999 by 3.90 thousand Sq. Kms. as compared to 1997. In the year 1997, as compared to 1993, the total forest cover has decreased by 6.71 thousand Sq. Kms. The states, which have shown significant decline in the forest covers, were Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Whereas the states of Gujrat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal have shown an increase in forest cover.
                        To regulate unabated diversion of forestland for non-forestry purposes, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted. It has resulted in reduction of diversion of forest area for non-forestry purposes considerably and the present rate of diversion is 16,000 hectare annually (Economic Survey of India, 1998-99). Forests are an important natural resource of India. They play an important role in providing raw materials to industries and generating income and 9 employment. Forests also play an important role in enhancing the quality of environment by influencing the ecological balance and life support system (checking soil erosion, maintaining soil fertility, conserving water, regulating water cycles and floods, balancing carbon dioxide and oxygen content in atmosphere etc. They have moderate influence against floods and thus they protect the soil erosion.</td>
                    <td >The population growth has resulted in a downward trend in per capita availability of forest and
                        agricultural land since the 1950s. Per capita availability of forests in India is much lower than the
                        world average. The per capita availability of forest land and agricultural land is depicted in Table
                        7. Overall, per capita availability of forestland had oscillated around 0.113 hectare during the
                        1950s, and then has consistently declined. The per capita availability of forest land declined from
                        0.124 hectares per capita from 1960-61 to 0.071 hectares in 1998-99 - a level that is extremely
                        low compared to the world standards. The growth of population is expected to be faster than
                        hoped for improvements in forest cover as well as quality. Over the last ten years, despite
                        governmental initiatives of joint forest management, tree grower's co-operative movements and
                        other efforts tangible results are still to be observed, and forest depletion and degradation is still
                        increasing. Similarly, the per capita availability of agricultural land in rural areas has decline
                        consistently from 0.638 hectare in 1950-51 to 0.271 hectare in 1998-99 and is expected to decline
                        further as population continues to grow. </td>

                        the country. Increasing trends in per capita availability of food grains is largely due to cereals.
                        Although, per capita availability of pulses seems to have gone down since 1961 but the availability
                        of the edible oil, sugar and cotton cloth depict an increasing trend. Overall the per capita availability
                        of food grains had gone up from 395 grams per capita per day in 1951 to 458 grams per capita per
                        day in 1999-2000. The per capita availability of cereals increased from 334 grams per capita per day
                        in 1951 to 426 grams per capita per day in 1999-2000. Furthermore, per capita availability of pulses
                        10
                        declined from 61 grams per capita per day to 32 grams per capita per day over the period.

                        consistently increased during the period. Of course, availability does not mean accessibility
                        because of lack of purchasing power among poor sections of society. However, better
                        organizational management can assure better distribution and thus consumption when the

                            Protection of earth's biological diversity is an important goal in its own right. Biodiversity has
direct consumptive value in food, agriculture, medicine, industry etc. It also has the aesthetic and
recreational value. The greatest threat to biodiversity is not destruction of plants and animals per
se, but rather the destruction of their habitat. India is one of the 12 mega-biodiversity countries of
the world. From about 70 percent of the total geographical area surveyed so far 46,000 plant
species and 81,000 animal species representing about 7 percent of the world's flora and 6.5
percent of the world's fauna have been described. Population growth leads to expanding human
settlements and increasing demand for food, fuel and building materials. Modernization of
agriculture also threatens potentially valuable local crops. Biodiversity the world over is in peril
because the habitats are threatened due to such development programmes as creation of
reservoirs, mining, forest clearing, lying of communication and transport networks etc. It is
estimated that in the worldwide perspective slightly over 1000 animal species and sub-species are
threatened with the extinction rate of one per year, while 20,000 flowering plants are thought to
be at risk (Compendium of Environment Statistics, 2000).

                        like air pollution and global warming. In most urban areas of India, air pollution has worsened
                        due to traffic congestion, poor housing, poor sanitation and drainage and garbage accumulation.
                        The environmental effects of fuels like oil and petroleum products are of growing concern owing

                            The environmental effects due to increasing consumption levels of fuels like coal; lignite, oil and
nuclear etc. are of growing concern to various researchers. The combustion of these fuels in
industries has been a major source of pollution. Coal production through open cast mining; its
supply to and consumption in power stations and industrial boilers leads to particulate and
gaseous pollution, which can cause pneumoconiosis, bronchitis and respiratory diseases. The
energy production/consumption in India during 1950-51 to 2000-2001 is depicted in Table 10.
Energy production and consumption has increased steadily in India since 1950 onwards. The
production of coal and lignite has increased from 32.2 million tons in 1950-51 to 313.70 million
tons in 2000-2001, an increase of 9.74 times. The production of petroleum products registered an
increase of 29 times, from 3.3 million tons in 1950-51 to 95.6 million tons in 2000-2001.

The bulk of commercial energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels viz. coal and lignite in
solid form, petroleum in liquid form and gas in gaseous form. In addition to emission of
greenhouse gases, the burning of fossil fuels has led to several ecological problems and
associated with health problems like cancer risk, respiratory diseases and other health problems.
Burning of traditional fuel adds a large amount of carbon-di-oxide into atmosphere and increases
air pollution.

                        in less than five years (Brandson and Honmon, 1992). The indoor air pollution may pose an even
                        greater hazard for human health. Cooking and heating with wood, crop residues, animal dung,
                        and low-quality coal produce smoke that contains dangerous particles and gases. When fuels
                        such as these are burned indoors, using inefficient stoves and poor ventilation, they can cause
                        tuberculosis, other serious respiratory diseases, and blindness (Mishra, Retherford and Smith,
                        1999). In fact, indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with unsafe fuels has been
                        designated by the World Bank as one of the four most critical environmental problems in
                        developing countries. </td>

                            The country's large population and rapidly increasing energy use plays an important and growing
role in global warming. Global warming can have major physical, environmental and socioeconomic consequences, which can be both positive and negative. The estimation of these
impacts is complex and marked with uncertainties. Climate change would cause changes in
14
precipitation patterns, ocean circulation and marine systems, soil moisture, water availability, and
sea level rise. These would make an impact on agriculture, forestry and natural eco-systems like
wetlands and fisheries. Also with rising temperatures, and subsequent increasing heat stress and
alternation in patterns of vector-borne diseases, the global population would be more vulnerable
to health problems, causing disruptions in settlement patterns and large-scale migration. All these
would have significant socio-economic consequences (Compendium of environment statistics,
2000).

    <h1>Policy implications </h1>
    <p>From the various effects of human beings on environmental degradation, discussed in this paper,
        it appears that if human beings want to exist on earth, there is now high time to give top priority
        to protect natural resources and environment. The creation of employment opportunities is
        essential in agricultural areas with high poverty, unemployment and landlessness. Poverty also
        affects the demographic characteristics of the population and hinders the transition to slower
        population growth. There is a need to control poverty and population growth below replacement
        level in the country. Unless significant measures are taken to incorporate environmental concerns
        into agricultural development, urban planning, technological innovations, industrial growth, and
        resource management, the situation is likely to worsen in the future. There is a need control
        pollution of all types for a healthy living. Special efforts should be made for informing and
        educating the people and local leaders about the adverse effects of large population through
        specially designed Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities. In order to
        increase green cover and to preserve the existing forests, afforestation and social forestry
        programmes should be implemented at the local level. There is a need for preventive and curative
        measures to control water pollution due to chemical fertilizers, pesticides and other wastes.
        Wastewater treatment plants should be established in accordance with the need of time and its
        usage should be encouraged. The heavy penalty should be imposed on industries disposing off
        the wastes into the river. Moreover, the landfills are to be properly managed to prevent ground
        water contamination. More emphasis should be laid on compulsory environmental education at
        the school level in order to make people aware of the environment protection. The environment
        protection should not be a responsibility of government alone but local people and leaders should
        be encouraged to make dedicated efforts to eradicate the environmental problems. </p></div>

    <h1>Summary and Conclusions</h1>
    <p>The outcomes of high population growth rates are increasing number of people below poverty
        line, an increasing population density, and pressure on natural resources. The study reveals that
        the country's population growth and poverty is imposing an increasing burden on the country's
        limited and continually degrading natural resource base. The natural resources are under
        increasing strain, even though the majority of people survive at subsistence level. It will
        17
        increasingly difficult to satisfy the basic needs of a growing population even at present levels of
        consumption, and the situation will deteriorate progressively as the per capita consumption of
        resources increases. Population pressure on arable land contributes to the land degradation, thus
        affecting the productive resource base of the economy. The increasing population numbers and
        growing affluence have already resulted in rapid growth of energy production and consumption
        in India and this trend can only be expected to accelerate in the future. The environmental effects
        like air pollution and global warming are of growing concern owing to increasing consumption
        levels. However, environmental pollution not only leads to deteriorating environmental
        conditions but also have adverse effects on the sustainable development and health of people.
        The considerable amount of both ground water and surface water contamination due to chemical
        fertilizers and insecticides in the country leads to various water borne diseases. The growth of
        population is a fundamental factor in its relationship to natural resources, environment and
        technology. To sum up, there is an urgent need to control population and poverty, conserve and
        protect natural resources and the environment for healthy human beings. </p></div>
